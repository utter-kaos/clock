# Alarm Clock

This is a simple alarm clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I needed an alarm clock and had an old laptop lying around, so I decided to make use of it.

## Future Plans
- Build a physical version of this clock.
- Experiment with rendering the HTML clock interface on an Adafruit eInk display.
